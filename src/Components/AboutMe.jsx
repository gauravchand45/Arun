            Welcome, aspiring journalists, to the realm of storytelling, truth-seeking, and the relentless pursuit of uncovering what lies beneath the surface. I'm <span className="font-bold">Arun</span>. With a career spanning decades, I've stood witness to the ever-evolving landscape of journalism, from the clatter of typewriters to the digital revolution that now shapes our world. From war zones to political arenas, I've dedicated my life to unraveling the complexities of our times, shining a light on the stories that matter most. With each byline, I've sought not just to inform, but to ignite change and inspire action. Now, as I step back from the frontline, my mission remains unchanged: to impart the wisdom gained through years of experience to the next generation of truth-seekers. Join me on this journey of discovery, as we unlock the secrets of journalism together.
